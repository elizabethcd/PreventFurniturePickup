# Glue Your Furniture Down
This mod adds options to prevent picking up furniture by type.

## How to use this mod

There are two ways to use this mod: by manually editing the config.json file, and by using the Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM) integration. I highly recommend the GMCM integration, since otherwise there's no way to change settings in the middle of a day. Please refer to GMCM documentation for instructions on how to use that mod. 

The config options are:
  * CanPickUpBed
  * CanPickUpChair
  * CanPickUpTable
  * CanPickUpDresser
  * CanPickUpDecoration
  * CanPickUpTV
  * CanPickUpLamp
  * CanPickUpRug
  * CanPickUpWindow
  * CanPickUpFireplace
  * CanPickUpTorch
  * CanPickUpSconce
  * CanPickUpFishTank

Each of them is just a boolean (either true or false), so you can turn on/off the ability to pick up each type of furniture.

## Questions?
